This is my first post to one of countless blogs I've tried to start in the past. But, hopefully I can keep this one up.

For the time being, check out a couple of repos I am working on these days

- [pyiiif](https://github.com/uchicago-library/pyiiif) where I am developing a Pythonic library for creating [IIIF Presentation](https://iiif.io/presentation/2/1)
- [iiifcollectionbrowse](https://github.com/uchicago-library/iiifcollectionbrowse) where I am working on running selenium tests automatically via TravisCI for every commit to Github
